//! The pose along a move whose pose CHANGES (M13.7's last owed item):
//! a coordinated 5-axis block leans from the pose held coming in to
//! the one it states while its tip travels, and the material the tool
//! sweeps at the poses between is as real as at either end. The solid
//! law (b2, [`super::solid`]) and the posed-contact law (f2,
//! [`super::contact`]) read a move at its end pose; this module hands
//! them the intermediate poses, by the controller's own rule, which is
//! [`super::posed_steel`]'s: the pose is modal (a move stating nothing
//! keeps the one held), the letters lerp between the two poses
//! ([`crate::cl::pose`]), the tip rides its straight line (an arc its
//! chords), and each piece is cut into intervals no longer than
//! [`STEP`] of travel at the stack's far end - tip travel plus reach
//! times the pose's turn - capped at [`MAX_STEPS`], never unbounded.
//!
//! Only a move whose two poses differ is this module's for the part
//! laws: a constant-pose or upright move yields no interval through
//! [`change`], so its law keeps its verdict and its cost
//! byte-identical. The fixture sweep ([`super::posed_steel`]) walks
//! EVERY posed move through [`intervals`] (a constant pose is the
//! same walk with no turn), and reads each interval's [`Interval::swing`]:
//! the farthest any pose INSIDE the interval strays from `am`, proven
//! from the letter rate rather than sampled at the ends - each letter
//! turns the axis at most one radian per radian, so the axis travels
//! no more than the letters' summed sweep (M13.8's continuous pose).
//!
//! Provenance: the modal pose law is RS-274's; bounded sampling of a
//! swept pose is textbook (Ericson, "Real-Time Collision Detection",
//! public material). Our own design; no vendor source consulted.
