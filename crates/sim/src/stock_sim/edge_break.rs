//! The operation owns its break (#303): the program verdict's credit
//! for the edge breaks a chamfer or deburr was asked to cut.
//!
//! Provenance: the bevel is the chamfer mill's cone law
//! ([`crate::cl::EdgeBreak`], machine-tool handbook geometry); the
//! verdict is this codebase's own column deviation (`deviate`). Nothing
//! from vendor binaries or output.
//!
//! The law: the part the program must leave is the model WITH every
//! declared bevel cut. A column the verdict convicted (more than `tol`
//! below the model's top) that lies within a declared break's plan
//! width, under a model top no higher than that break's edge, is judged
//! against the bevel instead: cut down to the bevel (within `tol`) it
//! is the finished part; cut below it, it is a gouge charged at its
//! depth under the bevel. Rest is untouched - a declared break is
//! permission to remove, never a demand that the bevel be cut. Nothing
//! else changes: an edge no operation declared, or a model top standing
//! above the edge (a boss beside the rim), keeps the model's verdict.
