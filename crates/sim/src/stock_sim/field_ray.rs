//! The ray-entry companion of the cut layer (M7.1 C): where the
//! vertical ray through a claimed cell first MEETS the swept solid.
//! Split from `field_cut` by the 400-line law; the storage rides
//! `field`'s struct, the sweeps live in `field_cut`, the consumer of
//! the numbers is `march`'s verdict walk.
//!
//! Provenance: a sweep of a convex solid along a segment is convex
//! (Minkowski sums - the same law `field_cut`'s distance rests on),
//! so its intersection with any line is an interval and the ray's
//! first crossing is a 1-D convex root, found here by bisection on
//! the same conservative distance. Nothing from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The law here
//!
//! - **The cell's cut magnitude measures the WRONG direction for a
//!   flank.** A pocket rim column says "tool wall 0.12 away" while
//!   nothing was removed above the center at all; a cone flank column
//!   says "0.06 away" while its surface stands 0.08 up the ray. One
//!   number cannot serve both verdicts - so the field keeps a second
//!   one: the entry distance up the vertical ray, NaN where the ray
//!   never meets the solid. The march answers a column by its entry
//!   when one exists (the cut's own surface, conservative to a lower
//!   bound) and by the cell boundary otherwise (the mesh's surface,
//!   exact for every lattice-straddled plane).
//! - **Conservative means the removed side.** `phi_sweep >= true
//!   distance` (`field_cut`), so a probe that says INSIDE is a proof,
//!   and a bisection that reports the last proven-inside point can
//!   only sit at or below the true entry: the estimated surface
//!   under-runs, the verdict over-reports the tool's reach, and no
//!   gouge is ever hidden by this layer.
//! - **Merged by a min.** The surface is the lowest entry any move
//!   proved (removals union upward along a ray), just as the cut
//!   magnitude is a running max - both commutative, replay stays
//!   order-independent.
