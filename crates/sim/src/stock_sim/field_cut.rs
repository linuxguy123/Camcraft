//! Swept-tool subtraction on the brick SDF field (M7.1 B): the
//! max-law layer, the closed-form tool solids, and the tube walk.
//! Split from `field.rs` by the 400-line law; the storage and the
//! sign live there, the construction in `field_gen.rs`, the solid's
//! own geometry in `field_solid.rs`, the ray-entry companion layer
//! (M7.1 C) in `field_ray.rs`.
//!
//! Provenance: SDF boolean subtraction (the distance-function CSG of
//! the published implicit-surface literature: stock minus tool is
//! `max(phi_stock, -phi_tool)`), the tool solids of RS-274 world
//! machining (capsule, cylinder, truncated cone - the same three the
//! dexel atoms sweep; the bull nose's rounded rectangle, M13.1,
//! specced in `field_bull`), and the chord reduction of this codebase's own
//! `arc_chords`. Nothing from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **Subtraction is a running max, so it commutes.** One layer of
//!   cut values rides the bricks: `phi_stock(p) = max(phi_mesh(p),
//!   cut(p))`, `cut` = the max over all moves of the negated tool
//!   distance of the move that reached deepest here. Max is
//!   associative and commutative, so a replay in any order answers
//!   identically - the ROADMAP's "sequential cuts accumulate as a
//!   running max, order-independent by construction", made literal.
//!   (The exact engine this mirrors, the dexel, looks order-dependent
//!   only because a column stores one Z; its removal is a min over
//!   bottoms, which commutes the same way.)
//! - **The tool solid is read exactly, never voxelized.** A move
//!   sweeps the solid along a segment; the solid of every instant is
//!   convex and the sweep is a Minkowski sum, so the distance at a
//!   query point is a 1-D CONVEX minimum over the move parameter -
//!   golden section to far below a cell. The ball closes further: its
//!   sweep is a capsule with a closed form. This is the ROADMAP's
//!   inverted-trajectory law: "does the solid, moved BACKWARD along
//!   this segment, contain p", with the containment made exact.
//! - **The conservative direction is the same one everywhere.** The
//!   numerical minimum of a convex function is an upper bound of the
//!   true distance, so the cut never over-claims removal (ghost rest,
//!   the blessed over-report, never a false clean); and the max
//!   layering keeps the field's sign promise: material answers as
//!   material unless the tool demonstrably reached it, whatever the
//!   cell size or band width.
//! - **Tool conventions mirror the dexel atoms value for value.**
//!   Moves carry TIP positions: a ball's center path is the tip path
//!   lifted by `r` along the tool axis (the +Z lift when the move
//!   carries no pose stamp - M5.1's `axis` field IS the inverted
//!   trajectory input); a cone's apex is its tip (virtual sharp); an
//!   upright mill tool's XY arc sweeps the true circle (#413,
//!   `field_arc`, the column engine's #402 law), while a tilted pose
//!   or a lathe tool reduces it to chords with Z interpolated
//!   uniformly (the helix law); and rapids touch nothing (RS-274 G0).
//!   The flat endmill's flank is finite and explicit (`flank`): a
//!   cylinder, not the dexel's infinite column - above the flank the
//!   field shows rest where the column law shows air, and the
//!   reconciliation at declared tolerance (stage C) passes a flank
//!   that spans the stock to agree.
//! - **Total input.** A non-finite move endpoint, a non-positive or
//!   non-finite tool parameter, a nonsense axis, or a move whose
//!   swept window - clipped to the region a cut can matter in (M7.3,
//!   `field_batch`) - would span more than `MAX_CELLS_PER_MOVE` cells
//!   refuses by name before a single brick is written.
