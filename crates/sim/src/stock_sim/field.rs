//! The signed-distance stock field behind the `stock_sim` seam (M7.1 A).
//!
//! Provenance: narrow-band sparse-field CSG and the brick (clipmap)
//! storage layout are published implicit-surface practice - the
//! multi-source BFS distance transform of Barilla et al. (2024) and the
//! brick-map discipline the Phase 7 reference note names. The sign is
//! the ray-parity law this codebase already ships in `solid_rest`,
//! reused whole. Nothing derived from vendor binaries or forensics.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The mesh stays the source of truth.** This field is the
//!   preview/verdict-display stock of Phase 7: what it says about a
//!   point answers "what is left here" where a column top cannot speak
//!   (undercuts, radially-machine bodies, 5-axis sweeps), and the M2.2
//!   parity module remains the sign's only author.
//! - **Sign exact, magnitude bounded.** The sign is ray-parity along
//!   the query's OWN ray, evaluated against the shell live: no cell
//!   size, band width, or BFS slack can ever call material "air" -
//!   material is never hidden. (A per-column cache of the CENTER
//!   ray's crossings is what this module planned first; it is not
//!   exact - a wall thinner than a cell can pass between the point
//!   and its column's center and flip the answer - so stage A keeps
//!   the honest live call and leaves the ray-keyed render-side
//!   acceleration to stage C.) The band magnitude is the BFS graph
//!   distance, within about a cell of the true distance near the
//!   surface, clamped so nothing past the band is ever bigger than
//!   `cap`; `cap` sits within two cells of the band's truth edge -
//!   clearance rounds TOWARD the surface up to that slack, the
//!   direction the ROADMAP's subtraction law and the dexel header's
//!   "over-reporting rest is honest noise" choose on purpose. Stage
//!   C retired this slack's verdict half without an eikonal: the
//!   seam's ray march (`march`) reads only the sign and the step
//!   bound, so column heights come out exact where stored values
//!   under-read. The eikonal sweep now belongs to the render pass
//!   (M7.2), where smooth shading wants the gradient honest.
//! - **Sparse by brick, not octree.** 8x8x8-cell bricks of f64 under
//!   a flat hash map; only near-surface bricks exist. An allocated
//!   brick's out-of-band cell is NaN, and NaN answers the same law as
//!   an absent brick: `cap`. A second layer (M7.1 B's cuts) rides the
//!   same lattice: `subtract` folds `max` of the swept tool's negated
//!   distance into it, and a query takes the max of the two layers,
//!   so subtraction commutes and can never hide material.
//! - **Total input.** A non-finite vertex, a zero-area facet, a
//!   non-watertight shell, or a nonsense cell size refuses with the
//!   defect named, before any cell is written. The query contract
//!   carries the law through: a non-finite point answers NaN, never
//!   a panic; an `Open` parity column (unreachable past the gate)
//!   answers material.
//! - **Orientation-free.** Distance reads points, parity reads
//!   crossings; flipping every facet's winding changes nothing (the
//!   `solid_rest` law (c), inherited whole).
