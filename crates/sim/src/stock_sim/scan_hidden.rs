//! The hidden-rest scan (M2.2d) and its budget, split from `scan.rs`
//! by the 400-line law (M13.1). Provenance: the parity-paired solid
//! truth of `solid_rest` (ray-crossing parity, the published
//! point-in-solid test) judged by the envelope's own distance law,
//! streamed in row bands (out-of-core scanline practice); nothing
//! from vendor binaries.
//!
//! ## The law here
//!
//! - **Over budget is "not judged", never zero** (M13.1, paying the
//!   M2.2 debt the ROADMAP names): past its budget the scan cannot
//!   answer, and it says so through the report's type
//!   (`HiddenRest::OverBudget`) instead of the old stated zero that
//!   read exactly like "no hidden rest". Every consumer shows the
//!   unjudged state by name.
//! - **Past the holding budget the scan streams** (M13.1, #24): the
//!   `cells` / `claims` numbers bound what one pass HOLDS, not what
//!   the verdict may read. A lattice whose claims do not fit at once
//!   is counted row by row, cut into bands that do, and judged band
//!   after band by the very same body - each column sees the same
//!   claims, the same pairing, the same distance law, so the banded
//!   answer is the whole-lattice answer, bit for bit (rows ascend,
//!   ties keep the first worst). Nothing is sampled coarser: a
//!   skipped column could hide a ledge, and a false clean is a
//!   gouge-class bug.
//! - **The walk is bounded too.** Every facet-column visit and every
//!   ball-center distance is counted against `work`; past it, or when
//!   one row's claims alone cannot be held, the scan still answers
//!   `OverBudget` - a stated refusal, never a hang and never a zero.
