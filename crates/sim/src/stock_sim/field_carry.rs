//! A field carried between setups (#637 steps A, C): the SAME field - its
//! shell, its closed-form box (#633), its cut layers - viewed through a
//! setup change's rigid turn, never re-sampled. A signed distance field
//! is invariant under rigid motion, so the distance from `p` to the
//! carried solid is the distance from `T^-1 p` to the original: exact,
//! the field analogue of `carry`'s "re-index, never re-sample".
//!
//! Phase 1 keeps `carry`'s scope: the eight lattice turns (`LatticeTurn`,
//! Z kept on +-Z), so a vertical column in the new frame is a vertical
//! column (perhaps reversed) in the field's own - the verdict march
//! stays exact. Every other turn is refused upstream by
//! `CARRY_TURN_REFUSAL`.
//!
//! Provenance: rigid-motion invariance of the Euclidean distance (any
//! geometry text); our own design after #637's research comment.
