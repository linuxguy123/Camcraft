//! camcraft-sim - the sim/verify seam of the M4.1 crate split (R4,
//! docs/M4.1-CRATE-SPLIT.md). Everything here consumes DATA: facets,
//! stock grids, tool records, paths - never entities. The
//! document-facing halves (`stock_sim::stock_grid`, the app's
//! `stock_sim`/`fixture` modules that walk setups) stayed in app and
//! re-export this crate whole: the model/setup knot the design note
//! feared was never cut - it dissolved, because the engine already
//! spoke in tuples and only the world half knew it.
//!
//! Provenance: dexel stock simulation and swept-envelope verification
//! are general CAM practice, specced from machine-tool handbooks and
//! published verification literature; every algorithm here is ours.
//! No flecs, no schema.
