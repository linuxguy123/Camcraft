//! The unsaved-changes guard (#107): New, Open and Quit over a document
//! with unsaved changes are held back until the user answers Save /
//! Don't Save / Cancel. The flag itself belongs to the app layer
//! (`History::is_dirty` - the history position against the last save or
//! load); this module only holds the action and resolves the answer.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design, specced from common desktop-editor
//! save-on-close behavior; no HSMWorks material involved.
