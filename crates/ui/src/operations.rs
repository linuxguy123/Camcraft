//! The 2D operation parameter law: the type-change rule (`retype`), the
//! quick-add seed (`quick_params`), the wording of a height row
//! (`offset_label`, `height_echo`, `unresolved_note`) and the display-side
//! warning fold (`fold_warnings`). The panels that consume these live in
//! `egui_app::pages` and `egui_app::panes`; the imgui originals retired at
//! M1.4.2 M-g, so this module is where each string and default exists
//! exactly once, for whichever surface paints it.
//!
//! Provenance: our own law, specced from public CAM context-property
//! pages; parameter names follow the published machining vocabulary
//! (stepover, stock to leave, climb/conventional, lead in/out, tabs).
//!
//! Like every part of the UI layer this never touches the world ad hoc:
//! surfaces edit the `State` drafts and queue `CommandKind`s, and the
//! `sync_*_ui` methods refetch the truth from the components. Status and
//! warnings are computed on read, so a page cannot display a stale claim
//! about a stale path.
