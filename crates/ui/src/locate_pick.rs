//! The locate-in-fixture pick draft (#561): while a Fixtures page row or
//! the Model page collects mates, a viewport Face or Vertex click lands
//! here instead of in the open operation's geometry - first the part's
//! face or point, then the fixture's face or point it sits on, one mate
//! per pair, up to three (floor, jaw, stop). Ephemeral view state like
//! the lay-on-a-plane draft (#330) - nothing here writes the world;
//! Apply queues the undoable `Locate` through `CommandKind::Locate`.
//!
//! Provenance: our own UI over 3-2-1 fixturing practice; no vendor
//! material consulted.
