//! The shell's document state: world + history + deferred actions.
//!
//! Provenance: our own app state, specced from public CAM session behavior.
//! Panel code never mutates the world directly - it queues a `CommandKind`,
//! which is executed once per frame outside the ImGui borrow (dialog code
//! must not run mid-frame).
//!
//! File imports run the parse/tessellation on a worker thread so a heavy
//! STEP never freezes the window; the resulting `ImportModel` command is
//! executed on this thread, so the history stays the single source of truth.
