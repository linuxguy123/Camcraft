//! The egui shell's pane layer, graduated from the spike's panels.rs -
//! every pane a faithful re-implementation of its imgui original (the
//! retired ribbon.rs/browser.rs): same strings, same command shapes, same
//! enabled rules. The strips are painted (super::painted) because that is
//! the law the spike proved; the property pages moved to `pages` with M-c,
//! leaving this module the keyboard layer and the two painted panes. Since
//! M-g the bundled Tabler glyphs ride both strips as egui textures
//! (super::icons), with the painted vector marks as their no-GPU twins -
//! the retired imgui icons module folded into this stack, not replaced.
//!
//! Layering holds (AGENTS.md): world access is `camcraft_app`'s public API
//! only, and every change goes through `state.pending` / the command
//! methods, never an ad-hoc field poke. The whole-pane law
//! (docs/spike-egui-go-no-go.md) forbids porting a pane by halves.
//!
//! Since M-f the surfaces here stopped forking their own command logic: the
//! ribbon cells, browser rows and keyboard shortcuts all fire through the
//! shared `crate::actions` layer - the same one the imgui ribbon/browser/menu
//! call - so each effect lives exactly once across both shells. `Cmd::Paths`
//! stays a direct field flip (view state, mirroring imgui ribbon.rs) and the
//! browser pushes its `Select` alongside `actions::target` (the tree law).
