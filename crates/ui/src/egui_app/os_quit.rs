//! OS-level quit requests (#144): on macOS, Cmd+Q, the app menu's Quit,
//! the Dock's Quit and a logout all send `terminate:` to NSApplication,
//! which winit 0.30 lets end the process at once - its application
//! delegate has no `applicationShouldTerminate:`, so the unsaved-changes
//! prompt (#107) was skipped. `install` adds that method to winit's
//! delegate class: it answers "cancel" and raises a flag, and the shell
//! turns the flag into the same guarded Quit the window X sends.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design, specced from Apple's published
//! NSApplicationDelegate documentation (applicationShouldTerminate: /
//! NSTerminateCancel) and the Objective-C runtime reference
//! (class_addMethod); no HSMWorks material involved.
