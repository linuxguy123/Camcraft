//! The egui shell (M1.4.2 migration), selected with `--ui egui`.
//!
//! Graduated from the M1.4.1 spike binary: `shell` runs the loop, `world`
//! collects the scene through the shared `crate::interact` law and holds the
//! demo seed, `theme` carries the color tokens, `painted` is the draw-list
//! port (ribbon cells, tree rows), `panes` holds the keyboard layer and the
//! painted ribbon and browser (M-b), and `pages` the property pages (M-c).
//! Since M-d the window opens on a plain empty document - `world::seed` is
//! what the harnesses and the headless proof call directly. Since M-e the
//! viewport takes pointer gestures: `shell`'s viewport panel drives the same
//! `crate::interact` pick, hover and camera functions the imgui shell does,
//! from egui's own input state. Since M-f the surfaces here fire commands
//! through the shared `crate::actions` layer - the entry every surface,
//! here and (until it retired) on the imgui side, calls - so the effects
//! live once. At M-g imgui retired and this is the shell
//! (docs/spike-egui-go-no-go.md, migration law); the generators, commands
//! and persistence underneath were shared and untouched throughout. Since
//! M1.5 the viewport wears its corner furniture - `viewcube` owns the
//! cube's drawing, its face/edge/corner pick law and the nav bar, and
//! keeps the gesture-eating rule (a press on the furniture arms nothing)
//! in one place.
//! Provenance: our own code, from our own spike.
