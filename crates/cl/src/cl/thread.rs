//! The threading intent record (issue #34): what a thread's cycle is,
//! standing beside the explicit helical passes that cut it.
//!
//! Provenance: the quantities a lathe control's multi-pass threading
//! cycle asks for - start and end of the thread, major / minor
//! diameter, lead, thread height, first-pass and minimum depth, finish
//! allowance, infeed angle, spring passes, pull-out - as public lathe
//! programming references and machine-tool handbooks list them
//! (behaviour only). Our own model; no vendor material consulted. The
//! explicit passes remain the truth for verification, display and
//! simulation (the drilling `Cycle` law); the record is what a post
//! with a threading cycle writes in their place.
//!
//! The hand (issue #629): a helix is right-hand when it advances along
//! +Z while turning counter-clockwise seen from +Z - and stays so run
//! backwards (clockwise while falling). The turning frame stands the
//! free end at +Z and the chuck below, so the standard right-hand
//! thread cut toward the chuck is a clockwise-falling helix, which is
//! the tool's motion relative to a part turning M03 (clockwise seen
//! from the headstock). Screw-thread handedness and the M03 sense as
//! machine-tool handbooks and RS-274 / ISO 6983 state them.
