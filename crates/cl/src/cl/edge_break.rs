//! The edge break an operation declares (#303): the bevel a vertical-
//! axis cone cuts when its apex rides `depth` below an edge.
//!
//! Provenance: the chamfer mill's cut law - a cone of half-angle `h`
//! from its axis, apex `depth` under the edge, meets the edge's level
//! plane at radius `depth * tan(h)` (machine-tool handbook geometry,
//! the same law `machining2d::chamfer` and `finishing3d::deburr` ride).
//! The surface the cone leaves over a column `s` mm (in plan) from the
//! edge is `z_edge - depth + slope * s`, `slope = cot(h)`; swept along
//! the edge it is the lower envelope of those cones. Our own model; no
//! vendor material consulted.
//!
//! The record is the operation's statement of what it was ASKED to cut:
//! the edge it picked, the depth and slope its parameters state. The
//! generator makes it beside the moves, never reading it back off them.
//! The program sim judges the moves against it: a column cut down to
//! the declared bevel is the finished part, a column cut deeper, or a
//! bevel on an edge no operation declared, is still a gouge.
