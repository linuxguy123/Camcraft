//! The swarf pose-continuity law (the "swarf stamp flips hemispheres
//! mid-program" finding, RECOMMENDED.md): a ruling direction is a
//! LINE, so both signs of it are "the ruling" - and the stamp must
//! pick the sign that continues the pose the machine holds coming in,
//! never a fixed hemisphere. On the capped blade the fixed rule posed
//! the body +X whatever the lean law had landed on beside it, so the
//! program held four exact 180-degree reversals between consecutive
//! 4-6 mm feeds on the body and a 179-degree swing at the ring/raster
//! hand-off - a joint-interpolating controller swings the head
//! end-over-end at feed with the ball 2.9 mm off the blade mid-swing.
//! What is measured HERE is the program's own turn ladder on that
//! blade: two consecutive blade-lying cuts never change end (they turn
//! within 10 degrees), no cut of either swarf kind turns past the link
//! threshold off the pose held coming in (every wider hand-off - the
//! raster reversals, the ring's passages round the flat caps - rides
//! an air link: lift, swing on the plunge, re-enter on the same ball
//! centre), and the guard's named refusal (`stamp_link::guard_turns`,
//! unit-tested beside the stamp) is what keeps it so.
//!
//! Provenance: continuity of the tool-axis vector along a 5-axis
//! program is standard practice (a tilt-axis reversal is a linking
//! fault, not a cut); the fixture is the app's blade at debug size.
//! Written from our own design notes only.
//!
//! Gate map (M4.4): covers camcraft_motion::multiaxis (stamp, swarf).
//! Lane shape (M4.4): seconds.
