//! Issue #54: the rotary wrap on a bar that is not a pure revolve - a
//! D-flat (a planar flat ground part of the way round the bar). Specced
//! from the wrap/development construction in `multiaxis::rotary_offset`
//! (a closed solid develops to a sheet whose only free edges are the
//! seam's two copies) and plain solid-modelling topology (a closed
//! 2-manifold has no free edge); no vendor material consulted.
//!
//! Read here: a D-flat bar wraps in every placement (flat through the
//! ends, a closed flat) and its Offset-rings rough keeps every cut tip out
//! of the part's true cross-section. A flat across the DEFAULT seam, on or
//! off its centre line, used to be refused by name (PR #210's review:
//! wrapped there, it gouged to the axis); since #226 the wrap turns its
//! seam to an azimuth where the bar is turned, and refuses by name only a
//! feature all the way round. A bar with a facet missing is refused by
//! name.
//!
//! #228: a plain bar tessellated as two rings wraps in every
//! orientation (its axis fit is exact, not tilted by rounding), and a
//! seam refusal names a tessellation cause as well as a feature.
//!
//! Gate map (M4.4): covers camcraft_motion::multiaxis (rotary_offset,
//! rotary_seam, rotary_seam_angle, rotary_sheet, axis, axis_refine), on
//! this suite's own prism fixtures.
//! Lane shape (M4.4): every wrap here is Offset rings or a refusal;
//! the suite runs in about a minute in debug.
