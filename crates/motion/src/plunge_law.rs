//! The centre-cutting plunge law (M11.3, owed from B-D (4)): a tool whose
//! end edges stop short of its axis may never feed straight down into
//! solid - not on a level's entry, and not on any plunge between passes
//! inside a level (a zigzag row restart, a ring-to-ring dive, a slot or
//! bore re-entry, a 3-D ladder's pass hop, a second dive, a contour's
//! lead-in or stay-down plunge). ONE check every axial descent of the
//! planar, contour and 3-D ladders asks before it posts: is the column
//! under the tool already cleared at the plunge's depth by this path?
//!
//! The reading: solid is everything under the material's top that no
//! earlier cutting move of the same path has removed. A column counts as
//! cleared at depth `z` when an earlier feed - a straight, an arc, a
//! helix chord, a ramp leg - lying wholly at or below `z` passed within
//! `(1 - CORE)` tool radii of the plunge's axis, so the uncut core
//! (`CORE` radii about the axis, where a non-centre-cutting end mill
//! leaves a stub) sits over removed material. Conservative by design: a
//! ramp or helix still descending past `z` clears nothing yet, a rapid
//! never cuts, and stock the generator cannot see is solid. A wrong
//! "solid" only costs a helix, a ramp or a named refusal; a wrong
//! "cleared" would snap a tool, so there is none.
//!
//! Posed paths (the multiaxis kinds) are judged by the same law read in
//! the tool's own frame: a descent is axial when it runs down the posed
//! axis (within the core's cone, [`posed_axial`]), and a column is
//! cleared along that axis ([`cleared_along`]). An unposed move is read
//! in the same cone about world Z (M11.3 owed (1)): a straight within
//! 30 degrees of straight down is a plunge, not only an exact drop.
//!
//! Provenance: the centre-cutting / non-centre-cutting end mill
//! distinction of machining handbooks (a non-centre-cutting end mill may
//! ramp or helix into material but not plunge); the cleared-column test
//! is this crate's own geometry. No vendor material consulted.
