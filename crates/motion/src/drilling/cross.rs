//! Radial (cross) drilling on the turned solid (M5.2 F2): the live
//! tooling's cycle, plunged from a turret station along X or Y
//! toward the spindle axis. The moves state their tool pose through
//! `cl`'s existing axis machinery (the multiaxis contour law), so
//! verification reads the path's own truth - and the truth is a
//! horizontal chain the vertical height field cannot judge: the
//! kernel's caller verifies it in `Mode::Radial`, whose doctrine
//! (stands (a),(b),(c),(c3) down to the construction law, reads
//! (d)'s rapids as a solid against the raw stock - #79 - and keeps
//! the fixture laws) is stated where the mode lives. There is no
//! canned `Cycle` record for a radial hole yet: the chain is the
//! single truth until the post learns G8x-style radial vocabulary.
//!
//! Provenance: cycle semantics (drill, chip-break peck, deep full-
//! retract march, through-hole exit allowance) follow the public
//! RS-274 / ISO 6983 vocabulary, shared with `cycle.rs`; the
//! traverse law - every rapid between holes running OUTSIDE the
//! stock's radius by at least the cutter's own rim, and a station
//! change inflating the hop plane so the chord's closest approach
//! (never merely the endpoints) clears the bar - is ours, from the
//! law that a bar's face is curved and a chord over it dives into
//! steel; stage G's opposite-station travel - retract axially,
//! index, swing above the bar's end face - follows the same law
//! pushed to the one pair of stations no hop radius can save.
