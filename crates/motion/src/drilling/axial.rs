//! Axial drilling on the lathe (M13.5 A): the turret's simplest hole,
//! a drill held stationary on the spindle axis while the part spins.
//! The cycle vocabulary is the mill's (`cycle::drill` makes the
//! chain and the `Cycle` records); what this file adds is the
//! lathe's two laws around it - the DOORS a lathe-mounted drill op
//! must pass before a move is computed, and the VERDICT that judges
//! the finished chain against the modeled bore in the meridian,
//! where the vertical height-field laws (`Mode::Revolve` stands
//! them down) cannot see a hole that runs down the spindle.
//!
//! Doors, by name: a hole off the spindle axis (that is the live
//! tooling's radial drill, or an end-face hole wanting a C axis -
//! never this cycle); a hole bottoming past the bar's far end; a
//! drill wider than the modeled bore. Verdict: the hole recognition
//! re-reads the part (the hole list a user typed is never the
//! judge), and per cycle the drill must find a modeled hole on its
//! axis, be no wider than it, bottom no deeper than its floor (plus
//! the through exit), and bottom no shallower than it - rest by name,
//! not silence.
//!
//! Provenance: axial drilling from the turret as the lathe's own
//! hole-making cycle is machine-tool handbook practice; the doors and
//! the meridian verdict are ours, specced clean-room from the law
//! that a lathe's drill stands on the spindle axis and nowhere else.
//! No vendor material consulted.
