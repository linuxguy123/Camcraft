//! Stage C's pose law alone, read at one station's BALL CENTRE (split
//! out of `stamp.rs` at the AGENTS 400-line seam): the contact read,
//! the swarf law's ruled pose, the lean law - and, for the swarf
//! kinds only, the POSED fallback where neither speaks safely.
//!
//! The fallback is the "upright in the wall" finding. On the capped
//! blade the waterline rings under the equator turn off the tube's
//! end columns onto the caps, and there the ring's chords stand up to
//! three hundredths past the tangent distance: inside the plan's own
//! tolerance, outside the stamp's micron band. The stamp read air,
//! stated upright (the modal law's fallback for a program that has
//! leaned), and a 60 mm upright flute at the end column under the
//! equator stands 0.8 mm inside the tube - the verifier's conviction
//! at every link retract that inherited the pose. So a swarf stamp
//! reads contact to the PLAN's tolerance, and at a row the ruling
//! cannot read (the end columns' withheld claim, a cap, a rim edge)
//! it does not take the lean law's word blind: an overhang's normal
//! leans the spindle UNDER the horizon, so where the lean law's pose
//! dips, or stands its flank in the part, the station carries the
//! RULING instead - the region's own straight direction, level,
//! signed toward the air side of the contact where the normal says
//! which side that is (a cap face, a rim edge) and by the continuity
//! rule ([`ruled_sign`]) where it does not (the tube's end columns,
//! where the ruling lies in the flank). Either pose is stated only
//! with its flank proved in air ([`flank_clear`]); a row where no
//! pose clears refuses the path by name - never upright in the wall.
//!
//! Provenance: the lean law is `tilt`'s (ISO 10791-10 tradition); the
//! flank proof is the link law's own sweep. Our own design notes; no
//! vendor material consulted.
