//! Rotary offset roughing (M5.1 stage E2): the pocket ladder run in
//! WRAP SPACE - the developed surface of the fitted axis [`super::axis`]
//! - so a turned work is roughed by the machinery that already knows
//!   how to erode regions, dodge islands and enter levels, applied to
//!   a cylinder instead of a table.
//!
//! The map: every vertex keeps its axial station `v = (p - o)·û` and
//! its radius `ρ = |(p - o) ⊥ û|`, and its azimuth becomes the
//! developed coordinate `s = R_ref·θ` (θ measured about the `e1/e2`
//! basis [`axis`] fits; R_ref the work's largest radius, so `s` is a
//! true arc length on the skin). A facet with one vertex ON the axis
//! closes the lathe onto it (a pole, or the fan across a flat cap)
//! and sweeps a full developed RECTANGLE between its two rim
//! vertices' columns; every other facet develops as itself, and an
//! axis vertex never lands on an affine blend of a meaningless
//! azimuth - which is what lets a fan of wedges tile one closed
//! chain of chords per level instead of opening on every spoke.
//! Each facet also picks its own lap: a plain one when its columns
//! fit within half a turn, a seam one (one column riding exactly
//! 2π low) when they straddle the ±π branch, so the same mesh vertex
//! keeps one developed coordinate in every facet that shares it.
//! The mesh is then duplicated one full period (+2πR_ref in `s`) so
//! every chord chain runs into its own copy at the seam, and each
//! free seam edge left at the cover's two ends hangs a CURTAIN down
//! to the floor radius ([`super::rotary_seam`]: the meridian wall on
//! a revolve, the ragged seam column on a flatted bar), closing the
//! chain's two far ends. An open mesh is refused by name. A seam that
//! crosses a feature which is not turned (a D-flat, a keyway) is moved:
//! the azimuth basis turns to a seam angle where the bar is turned
//! ([`super::rotary_seam_angle`], #226), and only a feature all the way
//! round is refused. The wrap is a
//! closed solid exactly when the model was: a revolve's ring slices
//! to a closed contour at every level the way block work expects,
//! and a pass running most of a lap rewraps to a closed ring
//! instead of leaving a rest ridge at the seam. Levels in AIR - above
//! the part's skin, over a fatter bar - meet no facet and need no
//! copy: they clear one lap plus the seam pad (M13.8).
//!
//! With ρ as height, `pocket3d`'s island law reads exactly right:
//! part material stands above the current radius wherever the skin
//! reaches further out than the level, so a level's target is
//! precisely the columns already turned inside that radius, the
//! ladder peels ρ_max → ρ_min (ρ_max the STOCK's outer radius when
//! the caller hands one over a fatter bar - M13.8, where the levels
//! above the part's skin are the whole lap), and the ledge under a column's last
//! legal level is the finishing kinds' job - the same staircase law,
//! one seam over. End caps ride the wedge law too: their rectangle
//! stands at the cap's station between the axis and the rim, a real
//! chord closing every slice it spans.
//!
//! The world exit is [`wrap_exit`]: ball centers back at ρ plus one
//! tool radius with the tip posted under them (M13 pivot law), arcs
//! chorded, s-sweeps resampled, rapids and cut moves standing
//! RADIAL with the lean of [`super::tilt`], as in [`super::rotary`].
//! Unlike the twins there is no LEAN refusal: the developed cylinder
//! is neutral to which way the axis points - a bar may stand or lie
//! and the rough ladder runs the same. The caller's world
//! `top_z`/`bottom_z` window the STATIONS (the contour kind's own
//! `(h - o.z)/u.z` law) and are silently inert on a bar lying flat,
//! where no world plane names a station.
//!
//! Provenance: cylindrical/unwrapped toolpath generation and radial
//! infeed roughing from public CAM literature and turning practice;
//! composed on this codebase's own pocket, axis-fit and lean laws.
//! Nothing of any vendor's consulted.
