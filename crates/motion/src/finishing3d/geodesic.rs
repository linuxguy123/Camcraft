//! Geodesic finishing (M2.5 C): rings of equal GEODESIC distance
//! from the model's open boundary - contours that run WITH the
//! surface instead of level with the table, placed by arc-length
//! along the mesh. The catalog's story for the family is continuity:
//! where the surface lets one ball rest the whole way, a single loop
//! climbs out of the floor, over the wall and around the rim with no
//! Z break; where it does not - a sharp corner the lifted tangent
//! cannot clear - the loop opens into runs, and the opening is
//! counted by note, never hidden in a smooth-looking picture.
//!
//! Provenance: geodesic-distance isoline toolpaths are published
//! finishing practice (contours of the boundary distance field,
//! marched on the triangulated surface); the distance here is the
//! graph geodesic - multi-source Dijkstra on the welded edge graph,
//! Mitchell's continuous variant minus its star unfolding: the error
//! is the mesh's own discretization, the same currency every
//! tessellation law in this module already spends, and nothing
//! rests on it (placement is the FIELD's answer, safety is the
//! envelope's). Written from that geometry and our own design notes.
//! No vendor material consulted.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The field comes from a real boundary.** Edges that exactly
//!   one facet runs are OPEN; their vertices seed distance zero. A
//!   model with no open edge is refused by name - a closed shell has
//!   nowhere for the rings to start, and inventing a seam would be
//!   dressing a guess as a datum. Vertices the boundary cannot
//!   reach (a closed island riding along with the open mesh) are
//!   refused their contours and counted by note.
//! - **Distance along the mesh, never across it.** Dijkstra on
//!   welded edges; the iso value is interpolated linearly on each
//!   edge from the canonical (lower, higher) vertex pair, so both
//!   triangles meeting at an edge compute the SAME point bit for
//!   bit and the crease chain welds their segments exactly.
//! - **A contour point is a resting center, or it is nothing.** The
//!   normal is the lerp of the edge's vertex normals; the center is
//!   the surface point lifted by `r` along it. It must keep the
//!   programmed window and stand clear of every facet to `r - tol`
//!   (grazing contact included; the foot is on real geometry by
//!   construction). The lifted tangent is honest only where the
//!   surface is smooth enough for it: past a sharp crease it bites
//!   and the point is refused - the break is the mesh telling the
//!   truth about a corner the ball cannot roll.
//! - **Every entry is certified, every leg is certified.** A run
//!   starts by a vertical plunge down the tangent column - and the
//!   column must be clear from the clearance plane (the verdict
//!   lane's law, same currency as the rings: `r - tol`). A feed
//!   leg must keep the swept ball clear by `leg_clears`; where it
//!   does not, the loop opens and each piece gets its own certified
//!   entry. Moves speak TIPS (center lowered by `r`).
