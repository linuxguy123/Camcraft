//! Flat-area finishing (M2.5 A): the floors, and only the floors.
//!
//! Provenance: floor-only finishing is textbook CAM - the planar
//! shading of a Z-level model, ridden concentrically at the scallop
//! stepover (the same public Huang-Oliver formula the module laws
//! cite). The construction below is our own: flatness measured as
//! tangent-sheet rise across the facet's own box, the floor set a
//! rewritten `shallow` flag on the support scan, and one shared
//! `shadow_pass` so the choreography can never drift from the
//! contour family it borrows.

///   a floor no matter how finely it is tessellated;
/// - its tangent-sheet rise across its own XY box is under the
///   tolerance: a facet whose whole height variation over the
///   centers that touch it fits inside the surface deviation the
///   op already spends is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a level plane at
///   the finish. `m_xy · diag <= tol` - so a coarse slope is a
///   slope (the raster's, the rings'), and only ground that truly
///   lies flat claims the floor name.
