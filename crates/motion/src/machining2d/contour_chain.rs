//! Contour along an open chain (moved out of `contour.rs` by M11.2 C,
//! which taught it the level link): the cutter center rides a picked
//! run's own points level by level. Provenance: open-profile contouring
//! of published CAM practice (lead off the run's ends, plunge at the
//! start, retract between levels); RS-274 / ISO 6983 linear and circular
//! interpolation; the approach's lead extensions are the standard
//! contour lead vocabulary of published CAM practice. No vendor
//! material consulted.

/// Contour along an open chain: a run whose ends stop mid-edge instead of
/// a loop around material. The cutter center rides the chain's own
/// points: plunge at one end, feed through every vertex at each level,
/// retract at the other. Climb travels the chain in stored order,
/// conventional reversed, and the same air-side rule sends the lead-in
/// and lead-out off the ends - an open run has no material to its side to
/// keep off, so the ends themselves are where the lead lives. The tab
/// fields do not apply (there is nothing left held between passes), and
/// the level ladder, clearance plane and lead geometry are `contour`'s
/// reused. Between levels the tool lifts to clearance, or to the retract
/// plane when that is the level link; a keep-down link has no area to be
/// proved against here and lifts to the retract plane, named.
///
/// Half the tool overhangs the run on either side; a verifier told about
/// a surrounding region reads that as the wall it is, and says so.
