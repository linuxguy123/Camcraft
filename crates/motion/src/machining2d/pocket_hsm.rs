//! The planar pocket's HSM adaptive door (M11.4 C): where the entry
//! stands the tool, which bore it leaves, and one adaptive plan per
//! connected piece of the center area. The plan itself is `adaptive`
//! (provenance there). For a helix or plunge entry the plan chooses the
//! spot (round 2): the morph spiral wants the entry in the area's
//! kernel near its centroid (`adaptive::preferred_seed`), the fronts at
//! its widest point - and the ladder's entry law
//! (`levels::run_level_walks`, consumed, not changed) is handed that
//! spot as its certified room, so the plan starts exactly where the
//! dive ends. A helix too wide for the area is narrowed to the widest
//! it holds (round 3: at most [`HELIX_SHARE`] of the room, so a
//! channel's growth rings can part from the orbit), and said.
