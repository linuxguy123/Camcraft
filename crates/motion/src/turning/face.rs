//! Facing: the station ladder of radial passes (M5.2 A).
//!
//! The law this kernel stands on: the CL point is the insert nose
//! CIRCLE'S CENTER, held at `station + nose_radius` along the axis,
//! so the nose ball is TANGENT to the facing plane at every point of
//! the pass - it cuts exactly the flat it is aimed at and can never
//! cross it. No gouging is therefore a construction, not a check:
//! a pass at station s removes precisely the band [s, s+2r], which
//! is why an infeed over twice the nose radius is REFUSED (adjacent
//! stations would leave an untouched sheet between them) rather
//! than trusted to the verifier to catch afterwards.
//!
//! The passes all run INWARD, from the outer band to the axis: the
//! spun work presents its fresh face to the tool only on the cut
//! move. At the axis the nose first LIFTS off the flat it just made
//! ([`LIFT`] along the axis, #632) and only then rapids out, so the
//! retract never drags the nose back across the fresh face. Rapids
//! travel at `r_max + stepdown + nose`, the rotary rough's own
//! clearance law read radially, where convexity of the distance-to-
//! axis makes `r_max` an exact bound from the vertices alone. The
//! program opens with a rapid to that radius on the clearance plane
//! (#632) - a commanded, judged approach - before the first plunge.
//!
//! Provenance: lathe facing as radial passes at axial stations -
//! standard turning practice from machine-tool handbooks and the
//! RS-274 G1 vocabulary; the ball-tangent no-gouge construction is
//! our own, on the same nose-envelope law the verifier's envelope
//! scan measures with. No vendor strategy consulted.
