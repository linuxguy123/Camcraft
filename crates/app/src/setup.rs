//! Multiple setups: one stock with per-setup placement and machine context
//! (M3.2 stage A).
//!
//! Provenance: our own design; the setup/WCS concept is standard
//! machine-shop practice (a setup is one clamping of the part against one
//! datum system; a flip is an unclamp, a re-clamp with the parts' faces
//! exchanged, and a datum transfer, not an axis rotation). No vendor
//! implementation inspected.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **The implicit-setup law.** A world with no `SetupDef` entity
//!   resolves exactly the way it did before this module existed: stock
//!   is the entity named `STOCK_NAME`, offsets are `G54`..`G59`. The
//!   first `CreateSetup` on such a world MATERIALIZES `Setup1` pointing
//!   at those same existing entities - nothing is renamed, so every
//!   path, stamp and saved file predating setups keeps working
//!   untouched. `None` anywhere a setup is expected means "the first
//!   setup by name", which collapses to that same legacy behavior.
//! - **One order law, shared by call.** [`operation_order`] is the
//!   document sequence: setup rank first, explicit operation position
//!   within a setup (name order for legacy operations without a position)
//!   (`Setup1` before `Setup2`, always). [`active_operation_order`] is
//!   the active setup's program; posting, simulation and batch regenerate
//!   use it so one clamping produces one NC program.
//! - **Placement is per setup.** Part and stock locations are saved with
//!   each setup and restored on activation. Their geometry is shared;
//!   the active placement is the generator's world frame.
//! - **Inert until named** (AGENTS.md M1.6 law). The active-setup
//!   singleton is read only at command creation (what setup new
//!   furniture and new operations join); nothing digests it, so making
//!   another setup active staleness-floats no path. An operation's
//!   `setup` field, by contrast, flows into its stamp through the
//!   RESOLVED heights - a setup change that moves the stock or a WCS
//!   marks the operations that machine against it, all by machinery
//!   that already existed.
//! - **Rest masks are same-setup only** (stage A limitation, logged in
//!   RECOMMENDED.md): re-machining looks at operations in the
//!   CONSUMER's setup ahead of it. A cross-setup mask would need to
//!   transform one setup's cut state into the other's placement; until
//!   that engine exists, a later setup re-cuts conservatively (the mask
//!   law means that is wasted air time, never a gouge).
