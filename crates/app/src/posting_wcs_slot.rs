//! The work-offset slot law (#196, #329): which `G54`..`G59` word an
//! operation posts at, and the one-file refusal a per-setup pick brings.
//!
//! - **The setup governs.** Every operation of a setup posts at the
//!   setup's work-offset word (`SetupDef::work_offset`, set by
//!   `SetSetupWorkOffset`; unlabelled = `G54`), measured from the setup's
//!   one WCS (#342) - [`crate::setup::wcs_slot`] is the word law. A
//!   height measured from the work offset reads the same WCS (#329), so
//!   an operation cannot disagree with its setup by construction.
//! - **One program, one register per word.** A single NC file in which
//!   two setups post the same word with different placements would run
//!   the second setup in the first one's zero - the controller holds one
//!   `G54`. The one-file post refuses it by name; per-operation files
//!   are exempt (each file is one setup's, and its offset is set for it).
//!
//! Provenance: our own design notes over RS-274 / ISO 6983 work-offset
//! semantics (G54..G59 select one of six controller-held zero registers);
//! no vendor material consulted.
