//! Tool bodies (#368): a holder or assembly mesh attached to a tool,
//! placed in the tool frame by numbers (the model direction that is the
//! tool axis, the model origin's height above the tip), and the reads
//! every judging law takes from it - the tool with its holder widened to
//! the cylinder enclosing the body, and the body's own band stack for
//! the fixture laws. Specced from the revolved-solid reading of a tool
//! assembly in machine-tool handbooks; the frame change is plain linear
//! algebra. Our own design; no vendor file or source consulted.
//!
//! The laws here:
//! - **No body, no change.** A tool without a [`ToolBody`] reads exactly
//!   its own record, so every output stays byte-identical.
//! - **Never smaller than the body.** Laws that read one holder cylinder
//!   get the cylinder enclosing the body ([`HolderProfile::enclose`]);
//!   the fixture laws, the ones that name a collision, read its bands.
//! - **Refusals by name**, at the command and again at use: a body that
//!   is empty, non-finite, degenerate, flat, off the axis, below the
//!   tip, too large, or reaching into the flutes.
//! - **One body, one frame (#369).** A milling body is placed along the
//!   spindle axis ([`BodyFrame::Spindle`]); a lathe steel's in the
//!   turning tool frame ([`BodyFrame::Lathe`], `crate::tool_body_lathe`).
//!   The milling laws read only the first; a lathe body leaves the tool
//!   record as it is for them and is judged by the revolved-stock law.
