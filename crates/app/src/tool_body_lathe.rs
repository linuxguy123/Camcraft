//! Lathe-held tool bodies (#369): a holder or boring-bar mesh placed in
//! the turning tool frame by numbers (the model directions that are
//! radial and along the spindle, the model point that is the tip), the
//! clearance bands the revolved-stock law reads off it, and which tools
//! may carry one. Specced from the handbook turning-tool convention (X
//! radial, Z along the spindle); the frame change is plain linear
//! algebra. Our own design; no vendor file or source consulted.
//!
//! The laws here:
//! - **Lathe steel only.** A turning insert, grooving blade, threading
//!   insert, form gauge or boring bar may carry a lathe body; any other
//!   kind is refused by name, at the command, at `ChangeTool` and on
//!   load (`tool_body::fits`).
//! - **Refusals by name** for a placement that is no frame (a zero or
//!   non-finite direction, directions not square, a wild tip) and a mesh
//!   that is no body (empty, non-finite, degenerate, flat along the
//!   spindle, too large, its tip far from it) -
//!   `camcraft_tools::lathe_holder`.
//! - **An insert zone holds one insert, never the holder** (#396): a box
//!   about the tip the judge leaves out, reaching no farther along any
//!   axis than the tool's own record allows an insert to - its body size
//!   (`diameter`), a blade's half width along the spindle, and 25.4 mm
//!   (the largest ISO turning insert) at most - and never the whole
//!   body. Refused by name at the command, at `ChangeTool` and on load.
