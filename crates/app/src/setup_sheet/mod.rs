//! Setup sheets: printable setup documentation generated from CAM data
//! (M3.2 stage D).
//!
//! Provenance: the setup-sheet convention - one page per setup carrying
//! the stock, the work offsets, the fixtures, the program-ordered
//! operation table with its resolved depths, and the tool list with its
//! times - is standard machine-shop practice, and the sheet's shape was
//! specced from the SolveCraft setup-sheet reference images cited in
//! ROADMAP.md's M3.2 section. BEHAVIOR ONLY: no vendor text, template,
//! or layout file was copied; every string, column and alignment here is
//! our own.
//!
//! ## The laws here
//!
//! - **Determinism is the law.** The same document renders byte-identical
//!   text, every call. Nothing is iterated in entity order (everything
//!   comes from name-sorted queries or [`crate::setup::operation_order`]),
//!   every float goes through [`mm`], and there is deliberately **no
//!   timestamp** - a printed date would break the law, so the sheet says
//!   "resolved at render time" instead.
//! - **Resolved numbers, expressed references.** The depth columns print
//!   world Zs from [`crate::operation::resolve_height`] - the exact
//!   machinery the generation stamp digests through, so the sheet and a
//!   regenerate can never disagree. A height that will not resolve
//!   renders `-` plus an annotated reason line (via the public
//!   `crate::operation::missing_source`), never a guessed number (Prime
//!   Directive: visibly refused, never silently wrong).
//! - **Membership by the setup law.** The table lists exactly the
//!   operations [`crate::setup::effective`] resolves into this setup -
//!   including implicit members whose declared setup is `None` - in the
//!   one program order the post walks.
//! - **The sim is not free.** [`simulate_verdict`] is the only path that
//!   runs the dexel program simulation (a grid over the stock, not
//!   cheap); [`render`] never calls it.
//! - **No panics.** Every read is an `Option`/`Result` from the public
//!   model/setup/operation APIs; a half-built document degrades to
//!   "(none)" lines, and only a declared setup name that does not exist
//!   is an error.

//!
//! The sheet is split along its sections (the 400-line law): the
//! stock/WCS/datum/fixtures sections in `sections`, the operation
//! table in `operations` with its per-kind depth columns in `heights`,
//! and the tool list in `tools`. Every public path stays here.
