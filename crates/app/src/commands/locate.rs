//! `LocatePart` / `LocateFixture` (#561): put the part in a fixture, or
//! the fixture on the part, by mates (a part face or point against a
//! fixture face or point, up to the shop's 3-2-1) and a typed nudge -
//! one undoable command each. The solve is `fixture_locate::plan`; the
//! write is the move the part or fixture already knows, so there is one
//! transform model and one stock-follows law.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design over 3-2-1 fixturing practice (machine-tool
//! handbooks). No vendor implementation inspected.
//!
//! ## The laws these commands keep
//!
//! - **Validated at construction, refused by name.** Everything
//!   `fixture_locate::plan` refuses, plus "nothing would move". The
//!   interpenetration check runs here once and is carried as a warning -
//!   the part against the fixture, and the setup's stock against it.
//! - **A square stock stays square (#561 review).** The part write is
//!   `MoveModel::locating` / `AlignPartToSetup::locating`: a box or
//!   cylinder stock square to the setup keeps its orientation and its
//!   allowance on each side round the located part (`crate::stock_follow`)
//!   - the vise holds the blank square, it does not turn it with the part.
//! - **The part moves as part alignment moves it.** In a setup that holds
//!   the part as modelled the locate is a `MoveModel` (the document
//!   placement; the stock follows the part); in a setup that holds the
//!   part turned (#326) it composes into that setup's alignment through
//!   `AlignPartToSetup` (its stock and linked setups follow). The work
//!   offset is never touched.
//! - **The fixture moves as the Fixtures page moves it** (`MoveFixture`):
//!   the inverse transform, so the relative placement is the same
//!   whichever body moves.
//! - **Staleness is the stamp's.** A moved part changes what every op of
//!   that setup read, so they read Stale until regenerated, and undo
//!   puts the stamp's inputs back (Ok again). A moved fixture never
//!   stales a toolpath (the live-gate law, `crate::fixture`): the
//!   collision check re-judges at the new placement.
