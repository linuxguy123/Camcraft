//! MoveModel: place a part in the document - position plus any rigid
//! orientation (M5.2 stage G, "part orientation"). The full rotation the
//! ROADMAP deferred from M3.2 ("placement flip; full rotation M5.2") is
//! exactly this command's extra two angles: the data model always
//! carried a quaternion and every geometry read applies it, so the
//! rotation became an editor change, not a schema change.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design; a workpiece sitting in the machine at an
//! arbitrary orientation (trunnied, tilted on a sine plate) is plain
//! shop practice, and R = Rz ⊗ Ry ⊗ Rx is the standard yaw-pitch-roll
//! composition `SetWcsOrigin` already speaks.
//!
//! ## The laws this command keeps
//!
//! - **Placement is a Location, validated at construction.** Same
//!   chokepoint as every pose write (`check_location`, shared from the
//!   fixture module so there is one law): a finite position and a
//!   quaternion that normalizes, or the command never enters history.
//! - **The model's `Location` is the single truth for its geometry.**
//!   The same rigid placement change carries stock made from that model,
//!   or the stock of a document with one part. Existing operation stamps
//!   read the changed placements and become stale.
//! - **Pages own their verbs.** A fixture is placed on the Fixtures
//!   page (`MoveFixture`), a work offset on the Work Offsets page
//!   (`SetWcsOrigin`), and the machine table is derived prose - all
//!   refused by name, because silently accepting them here would put
//!   two commands on one piece of furniture and split the undo story.
//! - **`apply` and `invert` are pure writes**, so redo replays bytes
//!   and never re-derives.
