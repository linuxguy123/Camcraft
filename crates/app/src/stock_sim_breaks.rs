//! The edge-break bound (#529, follow-up to #303): the program sim
//! credits a declared bevel only within what its OWN operation asked
//! for. A cached record is file data - a hand-edited or corrupted
//! project could state any depth, and a deeper record would forgive a
//! real gouge under it. So each record is held to its op's stated
//! break width (`Chamfer2D` / `Deburr` `width`: the bevel's plan width
//! at the edge, `depth / slope` in the record's terms), and a record on
//! any other kind is not a declaration at all. A record over the bound
//! is dropped by name in the log; its columns are then judged against
//! the sharp model - stricter, never looser.
//!
//! Provenance: our own bound over this repo's #303 record.
