//! The cross drill stands off the RAW stock (issue #77): a cross drill
//! run before the bar is turned to size meets the setup's stock, not
//! the finished part, so every standoff the radial kernel measures -
//! the hop and clearance radii, the chord law between stations, the
//! feed-entry point above each mouth, the end-face detour - is taken
//! about the larger of the two. A stock wider than the part moves each
//! hole's mouth out to the raw surface along its own axis (the floor
//! stays where it was, so the drill feeds through the uncut skin), and
//! the finished chain is then proven clear of that stock rapid by
//! rapid - refused by name if any one is not, never posted. The
//! verify crate's rapid-in-stock law stands down in `Mode::Radial` (a
//! bore is a tunnel its height field cannot see), so this proof is the
//! only one the radial rapids get.
//!
//! Provenance: traversing only outside the uncut material is the
//! machine-tool handbooks' shop practice; the stock of a lathe job is
//! the bar as clamped (RS-274 / ISO 6983 radial measurement from the
//! spindle centreline). Closest approach of a segment to a line is
//! textbook geometry. Our own design notes; no vendor material
//! consulted.
