//! The lathe spindle law (issue #62): a turning op's axis of revolution
//! is fitted from the part's facets, but the lathe post writes every
//! diameter about the work offset's origin and every Z as world Z - it
//! programs a spindle that IS world Z through that origin. A part whose
//! fitted axis is not that line (a few degrees of lean, or a millimetre
//! off the origin) would be turned about a spindle it is not on: a taper,
//! an eccentric or a coned face the model does not have, and a lean in
//! one meridian plane gives the post nothing to notice. So the door is
//! here, twice: before a move is computed (`collect_job`), and again at
//! the post (`posting::program_ops`) against the origin the post is
//! about to receive - a work offset moved after generation must never
//! post a program measured from the old one. Off the spindle by more
//! than the post can write, the op is refused by name with the lean and
//! the offset it measured, and the act that fixes it.
//!
//! The measure is the whole rigid displacement, not the axis line alone:
//! every part vertex is read twice - (radius, height) about the fitted
//! axis, the generator's reading, and (radius, Z) about world Z through
//! the origin, the post's - and the largest disagreement over the part
//! is what is bounded. A lean `a` moves a point at radius `R` by `R*a`
//! in Z (a face posted as a cone), on top of the axis drift over the
//! part's height; a thin wide flange is judged by its radius, a long
//! bar by its length.
//!
//! The fit is outlier-resistant (issue #71): a keyway, flat or cross
//! hole is set aside and the axis read on the revolved surface, so the
//! refusal names that share and tells a misplaced part (move the work
//! offset) from a fit the features left in doubt (moving it may not
//! help). A part that passes with features set aside generates with a
//! note naming that share: those features are not turned.
//!
//! Provenance: a lathe's programmed X is the diameter about the spindle
//! centreline and Z is measured along it (RS-274 / ISO 6983 lathe
//! convention, any turning handbook); the tolerance is the posts' own
//! output lattice. Our own design notes; no vendor material consulted.
