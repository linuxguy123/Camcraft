//! What the centre-cutting audit reads as solid for the kinds that carry
//! no approach (M11.3 owed (5): Face and the 3-D finishes): the setup's
//! stock in the generator's own frame - its XY footprint and its top -
//! or, with no separate stock, the material the op cuts. Read only for
//! a tool that is not centre-cutting, so no centre-cutting path pays.
//! Rotary Offset reads the true revolved bar instead ([`audit_bar`], #16).
//!
//! Provenance: the stock-as-solid reading of the centre-cutting plunge
//! law (`camcraft_motion::plunge_law`); this project's own design notes.
