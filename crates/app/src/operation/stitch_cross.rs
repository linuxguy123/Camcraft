//! Open-run stitching across model entities (M13.11, the M1.5 leftover:
//! "two runs meeting across two model entities do not compose into one
//! ring"). Two parts butted edge to edge - a plate and the block it
//! sits on, a model split into bodies - carry one rim between them, and
//! a user who picks its edges on both sees one loop. After the
//! per-entity walk of `stitch` has taken every ring one entity closes
//! on its own, the runs it left are walked again here, open to every
//! picked model, welded on the same lattice, oriented by the same
//! shoelace law, and committed as one ring exactly as the per-entity
//! case is.
//!
//! Two things a single entity never had to answer are refused by name:
//! a junction three runs leave from (the picks spell two rings, and a
//! guess gouges), and a ring whose runs stand on different planes in
//! the walk's frame (the planar kinds machine one plane; a ring that
//! steps between two is not their boundary).
//!
//! Provenance: our own design notes. No vendor material consulted.
