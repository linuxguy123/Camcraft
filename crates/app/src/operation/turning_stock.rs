//! Issue #130: the setup stock read as the turning kernels' revolved envelope - the bar's widest radius about the part's own fitted axis (and, #229, its far end along that axis), the reading the meridian rapid law (#103) judges against; the shop rule that a lathe tool approaches clear of the bar's OD (machine-tool handbooks); our own design, no vendor material consulted.
