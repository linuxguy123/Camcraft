//! Lay the part on a G17 / G18 / G19 plane through three picked points
//! (#555): three model corners span a plane, whose normal - taken on the
//! side away from the part's material - is laid on the target plane's
//! axis through the face pick's own apply path ([`super::plane`]'s
//! `lay_datum`), so a face and three points on it cannot disagree. Point
//! 1 is the anchor set onto the plane's level. The optional 3-2-1 frame
//! also turns the part about the plane's normal until point 1 -> 2 runs
//! along the plane's first axis (+X for G17 / G18, +Y for G19) and moves
//! point 1 to the setup frame's origin. Pure: the result is a setup's
//! part alignment, handed to `AlignPartToSetup::new`; the work offset is
//! never touched.
//!
//! Provenance: our own design over the 3-2-1 (three-point primary datum)
//! fixture practice taught in fixture-design and coordinate-metrology
//! handbooks; the plane through three points is the cross product of two
//! spanning vectors, textbook vector algebra. No vendor material
//! consulted.
