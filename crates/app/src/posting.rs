//! In-app posting: the live world to NC text, through the CPS
//! architecture of [`crate::post`].
//!
//! Provenance: our own design; the three-file role split (script,
//! machine, intermediate) per `docs/CNC-INTERMEDIATE.md` and
//! ROADMAP M1.7, specced from Autodesk's published post-processor
//! documentation, behavior only, per the Clean-Room Protocol.
//!
//! The law here is the validation gate: a program is written only
//! when every operation is generated, fresh, and warning-free, AND
//! the program-level verification passes - no gouge in the material
//! sim, no limit violated on the mounted machine (M2.3 D; or nothing
//! is written at all - the Prime Directive's blocking rule). Context
//! resolution mirrors generation exactly - the same `resolve_params`,
//! the same stock box, the tool library's own rank for `T..`/`H..` -
//! so the posted numbers are the machined ones.
